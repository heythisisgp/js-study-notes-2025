What is ES6 (ECMAScript) and Explain it's Features?

First of all while explaining this we have to understand the difference between JavaScript & ECMAScript and then we can move for Definition and features of ES6.

- JavaScript and ECMAScript are two different names, but they have a very close relationship with each other. 
- JavaScript itself is a language developed according to the standards defined by ECMAScript. That's the Reason why I'm differentiating both.

=> 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐄𝐂𝐌𝐀𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭?
- ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, ES6 is the 6th major edition of the ECMAScript language specification that revolutionized JavaScript development.
- It introduced powerful features that made coding more efficient, scalable, and easier to developer.

🚀 Mastering Arrays in JavaScript! 🔢
If you're into JavaScript, you've definitely worked with arrays. But do you know their time complexity and best use cases? Let’s break it down! 💡
📌 What is an Array?
An array is a linear data structure used to store multiple elements in a single variable. In JavaScript, arrays are dynamic and can store elements of different data types.
🔥 Array Operations & Complexity
🔹 Access (arr[i]) → ⏳ O(1), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Search (arr.indexOf(x), arr.includes(x)) → ⏳ O(n), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Insert at End (arr.push(x)) → ⏳ O(1), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Insert at Start (arr.unshift(x)) → ⏳ O(n), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Delete at End (arr.pop()) → ⏳ O(1), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Delete at Start (arr.shift()) → ⏳ O(n), 📦 O(1)
 🔹 Sorting (arr.sort()) → ⏳ O(n log n), 📦 O(n)
⚡ Key JavaScript Array Methods
✅ map(), filter(), reduce() – Functional programming 🧠
 ✅ slice() – Extract part of an array 🍕
 ✅ splice() – Modify an array 🛠️
 ✅ concat() – Merge multiple arrays 🔗
 ✅ reverse() – Flip the order 🔄
 ✅ find(), findIndex() – Find elements 🔍
🔥 Best Practices with Arrays
✔️ Use push() & pop() instead of shift() & unshift() for better performance.
 ✔️ Prefer forEach() or map() over for loops for cleaner code.
 ✔️ Use Typed Arrays (Int32Array, Float32Array) for performance in high-computation tasks.
 ✔️ Avoid using nested loops inside array operations (O(n²) complexity).
🧐 When NOT to Use Arrays?
❌ When frequent insertions & deletions are needed (Use a Linked List instead).
 ❌ If data needs to be quickly searched (Use a Hash Table).
 ❌ When large datasets require efficient memory usage (Use Trees or Graphs).
💡 Pro Tip: Use Set() instead of an array when working with unique values to improve lookup speed to O(1). 🚀
